          <h3><p>Being part of a different community where we can share opinions and dive through discussions are for me one of the best practices 
            not only in web development but in software engineering generally. This is the kind of place where we can ask questions and accept
            other opinions or constructive critisisms. Here we can always be up to date with all the new patterns or trends in our field.</p></h3>

          <h1>Contribute</h1>
          <h3><p>Contributing by sharing a solutions we came up with, or by sharing a great blogs, tutorials for the benefit of everyone is another
            great practice together with discussing. We can contribute using different platform like github, where we can share to other people our
            insights while also learning from them. With these we can learn a lot from our possible mistakes which we can use to improve ourselves. This
            is also a great way to build our own portfolio.</p></h3>
