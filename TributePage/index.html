            <p id="img-caption"><strong><em>Richard Feynman</em></strong> was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics 
                of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. Aside from being a brilliant scientist, he is best known
                for his way of explaining complex ideas to others in simple, intuitive ways called "The Feynman Technique"; Hence he is called "The Great Explainer".</p>
